Human Resource Employees Analysis.
This project showcases a complete data analysis workflow, starting with raw data ingestion and cleaning using SQL, followed by insightful visualization through Power BI. The dataset contained inconsistencies such as mixed-format dates, missing IDs, and Unicode characters, which were systematically cleaned using SQL queries and regex filtering techniques.

After transforming the data into a structured format, I connected it to Power BI to build an interactive dashboard.  This end-to-end process demonstrates my ability to extract, clean, and visualize data to support data-driven decision-making.
