Welcome to my Data Analytics projects. This repository is a curated collection of projects that demonstrate my end-to-end ability
to transform raw data into actionable insights and compelling visual narratives.

My process consistently follows a core workflow: acquiring data from various sources,
cleaning and wrangling it into a reliable state, conducting deep analysis to uncover patterns and answer key questions,
and finally, visualizing the results to tell a clear and influential story.

The projects herein showcase my proficiency with a modern data analytics toolkit:

SQL (MySQL): For complex querying, data extraction, and database management.

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Visualizations): For automated data cleaning, transformation, and advanced statistical analysis.

Microsoft Excel & Google Sheets: For quick data manipulation, pivot tables, and foundational analysis.

Power BI & Tableau: For building interactive dashboards and creating impactful, business-intelligent visualizations.
